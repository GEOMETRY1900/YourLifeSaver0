                Children of all ages have been found to have more problems when they have been exposed to family violence,
                particularly coercive and controlling family violence.Children who are exposed to family violence have higher levels of emotional and
                behavioural problems than children who have not.

                <h3>What are the impacts of family violence?</h3>
                <p style="font-size :20px">
                    Children living in a household where there is domestic & family
                    violence usually know exactly what is going on and they may
                    blame themselves for the violence and tension in the household.
                    Domestic & family violence is a form of child abuse.
                    Children need support
                    to deal with the trauma
                    they experience and
                    the disruption it causes
                    to their development.
                    Unborn children or
                    small babies can also be directly affected by the violence and by
                    their mother’s fear or stress. Be aware that during pregnancy and
                    around the birth of a new baby there is often a greater risk of
                    violence. Many women are hopeful that these major life events will
                    change their partner. However, there is very clear evidence that
                    these times are often triggers for increased violence due to jealousy
                    and issues of control. Some children may not have the words to tell
                    you how it is affecting them, but their behaviors show you how they
                    feel.
