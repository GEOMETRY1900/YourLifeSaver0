                    homelessness services seek general
                    services (82% of women) but many
                    also need domestic violence assistance
                    (35%), long-term accommodation
                    (31%) and tenure assistance
                    (29%).However, few existing services
                    are specifically designed to meet the
                    needs of older women.
