                    If they have answered ‘yes’ to any of these, then there are signs that they are not being treated right, or that they are being abused. If they don’t feel safe, respected and cared for, then something isn’t right.

                    Please let your friends/ family know that they have the right to feel safe and to live a life free from fear.
